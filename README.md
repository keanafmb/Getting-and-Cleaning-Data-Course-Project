This repository is created as a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project in Coursera

It contains the following files:
    * CodeBook.md - a markdown file that describes the variables and transformations        made to perform the requirements of the project
    * run_analysis.R - a script that performs data preparation, getting, and cleaning       data. Specifically, it performs the following tasks:
        1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each         measurement. 
        3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
        5) From the data set in step 4, creates a issecond, independent tidy data set           with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    * tidy_second.txt - s the exported final data after going through all the               sequences described above.
